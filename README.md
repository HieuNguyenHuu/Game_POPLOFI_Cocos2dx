## About The Project

This is my Cocos2dx Game, I making this game with my interest about Lofi music and sport game like pongping game. POPLOFI its can be see a upgrade of  Pingpong game 
* Game controller:
The player who controls the board character by clicking on special positions on the screen mistakenly controls the character to move left to right for the wrong purpose of helping the character hit the table with the NPC. With that the ball will fly back and forth between the character and NPC based on the beat of the music in the game
* Music game:
Using short Lofi hip hop tracks brings a sense of relaxation to the player, especially when controlling the character's actions.
* Background and Object game:
background games and some of the in-game Objects react to the beats of the game's music
* Graphic game:
The graphics in the game are based on the Pixel art genre because the songs in the game are in the light lofi hip hop genre, so it is necessary to have such a light game background

Way to build this game again just creater your new Cocos2dx project and put **"Classes"** and **"Resources"** to direction of your new folder and build it
